# Prefetching
Prefetching is a technique used to improve cache performance by predicting future memory accesses and loading data into the cache before it is actually requested by the CPU. This can help reduce cache misses and improve overall system performance.


Hardware data prefetching works by predicting the memory access pattern of the program and speculatively issuing prefetch requests to the predicted memory addresses before the program
accesses those addresses.[^1] We say that prefetching can effectively hide the latency of memory accesses and improve performance if:
- The memory access pattern is correctly predicted
- Prefetch request is issued early enough, but not too early that the prefetched data just sits in the cache(even worse: it gets evicted before it is used.)
- The data arrives `just-in-time` for the program to access the data, 

I like to quote an example of ordering food while leaving for home from work.
>  If you order food just as you reach home, you will have to wait for the food to arrive. But if you order food while leaving work, by the time you reach home, the food will be there waiting for you.

 
But prefetching can negatively impact the performance:
- predicted memory addresses are not accurate
- Can increase the contention for the available memory bandwidth
- Prefetched data can evict useful data from the cache
- Prefetcher design is
  -  Aggressive and issues too many prefetch requests, leading to increased memory traffic and cache pollution.
  - Conservative and misses opportunities to prefetch useful data(lags behind).

## Prefetching Strategies
There are several prefetching strategies, including:
- **Next-line prefetching**: This strategy prefetches the next sequential cache line when a cache line is accessed. This is effective for workloads with sequential access patterns.

  - Current address is $A$ then prefetch $A+Block Size$    into L1.

- **Stride prefetching**: This strategy detects regular strides in memory access patterns and prefetches data at those strides. For example, if a program accesses memory addresses 0, 4, 8, 12, etc., the prefetcher can detect this pattern and prefetch the next address in the sequence.

  - Current address is $A$ then prefetch $A+N\times Block Size$ into L1, where N is the detected stride.
  
- **Stream prefetching**: This strategy detects streams of memory accesses and prefetches data for the entire stream. This is effective for workloads with streaming access patterns, such as multimedia applications and there can be multiple streams.

## Prefetcher Knobs
The aggressiveness of a prefetcher can be controlled by:
- **Prefetch Distance** which is how far `ahead of the current access` the prefetcher should fetch. 
 ~~~<img src="/assets/cache_model_pfdistance.png" style="width:50%; height:50%;"">~~~

- **Prefetch Degree** is the number of cache lines to prefetch for each access.

Based on the above knobs,

## Metrics of Prefetcher Effectiveness
- **Prefetch Accuracy**: Prefetch accuracy is a measure of how accurately the prefetcher can predict the memory addresses that will be accessed by the program. It is defined as:
$$
\text{Prefetch Accuracy}
= \frac{\text{Number of Useful Prefetches}}
       {\text{Number of Prefetches Sent to Memory}}
$$


_where Number of Useful Prefetches is the number of prefetched cache blocks that are used by demand requests_

- **Prefetch Lateness**: Prefetch lateness is a measure of how timely the prefetch requests generated by the prefetcher are with respect to the demand accesses that need the prefetched data. 
    - A prefetch is defined to be late if the prefetched data has not yet returned from main memory by the time a load or store instruction requests the prefetched data_(Even though the prefetch requests might be accurate)_.
$$
\text{Prefetch Lateness} = \frac{\text{Number of Late Prefetches}}{\text{Number of Useful Prefetches}}
$$


- **Prefetcher Generated Cache Pollution**: A demand miss is defined to be caused by the prefetcher if it would not have occurred had the prefetcher not been present.
    - If the prefetcher-generated cache pollution is high, useful data in the cache could be evicted by prefetched data. 
    - High cache pollution can require the re-fetch of the displaced data from main memory.
$$
\text{Prefetcher Generated Cache Pollution} = \frac{\text{Number of Demand Misses Caused By the Prefetcher}}{\text{Number of Demand Misses}}
$$
