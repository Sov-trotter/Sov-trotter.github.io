I'm an ASIC Engineer at [NVIDIA](https://nvidia.com/), working on power controller modeling for GPUs, while holding a Masters Degree in Electronics from [National Institute of Technology (NIT)](https://nith.ac.in/), Hamirpur.

Previously, I worked as a Software Developer at [Zellerfeld R&D GmbH](https://zellerfeld.com/) in Hamburg, Germany, developing tools for 3D printing and backend systems. I also enjoy contributing to open-source projects and participated in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2021/projects/6190617452871680), presenting my work at [JuliaCon 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZweyKK3jIs&t=5s).

I'm passionate about computer architecture, power & performance analysis, cache/memory subsystems, and hardware modeling. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, exploring optimization techniques, and staying updated with the latest developments in computer architecture and AI acceleration.
