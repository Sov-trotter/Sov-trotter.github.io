# GSoC'21
I am currently working on [Javis.jl](https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl), a Cairo based mathematics animation engine. 

# Teaching
I really wish to teach Julia or programming in general to whosoever is interested.

# Everything else
That's all for now. :) ~~~<br>~~~
But if you wish to collaborate on a project, I am more than happy to help. ;)
