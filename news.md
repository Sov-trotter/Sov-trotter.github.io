# JSoC'20
So JSoC is ending soon! I am almost done with the PR's just a few nit's and docs left. If you're someone from a geospatial/civil engineering background or even if you are slightly interested in data/models, do spare some trying out the new changes. You feedback will be highly appreciated!
# Teaching
I really wish to teach Julia to whosoever is interested! I wanted to conduct a workshop on the same back in college, but the lockdown won't be lifted soon. :/
# Everything else

I wish to take a small break(probably a week or so), I am not sure really. ~~~<br>~~~
But if you wish to collaborate on a project, I will be more than happy to help. ;)
