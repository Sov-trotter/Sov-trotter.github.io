# GSoC'21
I am currently working as an intern at [Julia Computing](https://juliacomputing.com/), assisting the development of a [cloud-based simulation platform](https://juliacomputing.com/products/juliasim/).

# Teaching
I really wish to teach Julia or programming in general to whosoever is interested.

# Everything else
That's all for now. :) ~~~<br>~~~
But if you wish to collaborate on a project, I am more than happy to help. ;)
